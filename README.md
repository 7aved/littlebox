# Using littlebox

#####Step 1: Download the littlebox CSS and reference it in your project (along with Bootstrap, if not already initialized):
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/littlebox.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/bootstrap.min.css" />
```

#####Step 2: Add a littlebox to your code. The same structure is used for any littlebox:
```
<lilbox>
   <lildiv></lildiv>
   <lildiv></lildiv>
   <lildiv></lildiv>
</lilbox>
```

#####Step 3: Add a littlebox class to set an icon in your littlebox:
```
<lilbox class="soundbar-box">
   <lildiv></lildiv>
   <lildiv></lildiv>
   <lildiv></lildiv>
</lilbox>
```
[See the full icon library.](http://littlebox.cabmaddux.com "littlebox")

Each littlebox icon is made up of three elements (<lildivs>) that are completely styled in css. Some littlebox icons are animated, others are not. Icons can be changed onEvent simply by switching and swapping classes with JavaScript.

# Compatibility
Littlebox icons work well in all major browsers, with slight variation in appearance across browsers. They have not, however, been well tested in IE. There is also some variation in littlebox icon animation across browsers.

# Contributing
Suggestions, feedback and contributions to the icon library or compatibility would be greatly appreciated.
