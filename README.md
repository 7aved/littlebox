# Using littlebox

#####Step 1: Download the littlebox CSS and reference it in your project (along with Bootstrap, if not already initialized):
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/littlebox.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/bootstrap.min.css" />
```

#####Step 2: Add a littlebox icon to your project. The same structure is used for any littlebox:
```
<div class="lb-icon lb-*"></div>
```

Each littlebox icon is made up of three or fewer elements, but can be called with as a single element with class .lb-icon followed by the .lb-* class associated with the requested icon.
